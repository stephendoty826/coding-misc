// Write an algorithm that does the following:

// Given a two-dimensional matrix, determine if it is a magic square.  The function IsMagicSquare will just receive a 2d matrix.  It is your job to make sure it complies with all the magic square requirements listed in the paragraph below. Return true if the matrix is a magic square. Otherwise, return false.


// What is a magic square?
// A magic square is a n x n square grid (where n is the number of cells on each side) filled with distinct positive integers in the range 1, 2, ..., nÂ² such that each cell contains a different integer and the sum of the integers in each row, column and diagonal is equal. The sum is called the magic constant or magic sum of the magic square.

// An example with 15 as the magic constant:

/**
 * [ 
 *      [2, 7, 6], -> 15
 *      [9, 5, 1], -> 15
 *      [4, 3, 8], -> 15
 * ]   / |  |  | \
 *   15 15 15 15 15
 */

/**
 * optimization
 * 
 * when looping through each row, store each element in "column" cache so you don't have to loop through again for the column values and you can find the sum of the columns and diagonals by simply doing a lookup on the cache
 *  - as you loop through the rows, check if matrix is not square, elements are not all positive, and elements are not distinct. Do all of this in one loop through the matrix
